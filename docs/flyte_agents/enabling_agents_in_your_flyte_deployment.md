# Enabling agents in your Flyte deployment

After you have finished testing an agent locally, you can enable the agent in your Flyte deployment to use it in production. To enable a particular agent in your Flyte deployment, see the [Agent setup](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/deployment/agents/index.html) documentation for the agent.

:::{note}
If you are using a managed deployment of Flyte, you will need to contact your deployment administrator to enable agents in your deployment.
