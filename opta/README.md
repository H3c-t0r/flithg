# Easy Flyte Deployment with Opta
[Opta](https://github.com/run-x/opta) is an open source cli tool made for developers to quickly get production-grade 
infrastructure up and running. With minimal yaml configuration, a user can setup an environment within their 
account/project on their cloud provider (e.g. AWS, GCP) and deploy containerized applications therein.
The flyte team has partnered with the Opta team to make Opta the recommended production deployment tool for flyte.
