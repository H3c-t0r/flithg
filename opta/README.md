# Easy Flyte Deployment with Opta
[Opta](https://github.com/run-x/opta) is a new open source cli tool made for developers to quickly get
production-grade infrastructures up and running. By specifying a few short yamls, a user can setup their
environments within their own accounts/projects on their cloud provider (e.g. AWS, GCP) and deploy applications
therein. The flyte team has partnered with the opta team to make opta the official production deployment tool
for flyte-- you can read more about it [here](https://docs.flyte.org/projects/cookbook/en/latest/auto/deployment/cluster/productionize_cluster.html)
and also visit the official opta docs [here](https://docs.opta.dev/)
