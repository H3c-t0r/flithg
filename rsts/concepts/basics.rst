       :classes: btn-block stretched-link
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
    **Workflows** are programs that are guaranteed to eventually reach a terminal state and are represented as

       :classes: btn-block stretched-link
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
    A **Node** is an encapsulation of an instance of a Task and represent the unit of work, where multiple Nodes that are

       :type: ref
       :text: Launch Plans
       :classes: btn-block stretched-link
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

        :text: Executions
        :classes: btn-block stretched-link
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
    **Executions** are instances of workflows, nodes or tasks created in the system as a result of a user-requested
    execution or a scheduled execution.

The diagram below shows how inputs flow through tasks and workflows to produce outputs.
