Meet Flyte
==========

Flyte is an open-source, container-native, structured programming and distributed processing platform. It enables highly concurrent, scalable and maintainable workflows for machine learning and data processing.

Created at Lyft, Flyte provides first class support for Python, and is built directly on Kubernetes for all the benefits containerization provides: portability, scalability, and reliability.

Flyte provides a single unit of execution (task) as a top-level concept. Multiple tasks arranged in a data producer-consumer order create the workflow, which is pure specification created in any language.

Why Flyte?
==========

Flyte's main purpose is to increase the development velocity for data processing and machine learning, enabling large-scale compute execution without the operational overhead. Teams can therefore focus on the business goals and not the infrastructure.

What makes Flyte different?
---------------------------

* Fully Containerized
* Extensible Backend & SDK’s
* Ergonomic SDK’s in Python and Java/Scala
* Versioned & Auditable - all actions are recorded
* Horizontally Scalable - execute a single task or a workflow, attach multiple schedules to a workflow
* Battle-tested - millions of pipelines executed per month
* Vertically-Integrated Compute - serverless experience
* Deep understanding of data-lineage & provenance
* Operation Visibility - cost, performance, etc.
* Cross-Cloud Portable Pipelines

At Lyft, Flyte has served production model training and data processing for over four years, becoming the de-facto platform for the Pricing, Locations, ETA and Mapping teams.

Whether you will be writing Flyte workflows, deploying the Flyte platform to your k8 cluster, or would like to extend and contribute to the architecture and design of Flyte, we have what you need.
