Meet Flyte
==========

Flyte is an open-source, container-native, structured programming and distributed processing platform. It enables highly concurrent, scalable and maintainable workflows for machine learning and data processing.

Created at `Lyft <https://www.lyft.com/>`__ in collaboration with Spotify, Freenome and many others, Flyte provides first class support for Python, Java, and Scala, and is built directly on Kubernetes for all the benefits containerization provides: portability, scalability, and reliability.

The core unit of execution in Flyte is the ``task``, which you can easily write with the Flytekit Python SDK:

.. code:: python
   
   @task
   def greet(name: str) -> str:
       return f"Welcome, {name}!"

You can compose one or more tasks to create a ``workflow``:

.. code:: python

   @task
   def add_question(greeting: str) -> str:
       return f"{greeting} How are you?"
   
   @workflow
   def welcome(name: str) -> str:
       greeting = greet(name=name)
       return add_question(greeting=greeting)

   welcome("Traveler")
   # Output: "Welcome, Traveler! How are you?"


Why Flyte?
==========

Flyte's main purpose is to increase the development velocity for data processing and machine learning, enabling large-scale compute execution without the operational overhead. Teams can therefore focus on the business goals and not the infrastructure.

Core Features
-------------

* Container Native
* Extensible Backend & SDK’s
* Ergonomic SDK’s in Python, Java & Scala
* Versioned & Auditable - all actions are recorded
* Matches your workflow - Start with one task, convert to a pipeline, attach multiple schedules or trigger using a programmatic API or on-demand
* Battle-tested - millions of pipelines executed per month
* Vertically-Integrated Compute - serverless experience
* Deep understanding of data-lineage & provenance
* Operation Visibility - cost, performance, etc.
* Cross-Cloud Portable Pipelines

Who's Using Flyte?
------------------

At `Lyft <https://eng.lyft.com/introducing-flyte-cloud-native-machine-learning-and-data-processing-platform-fb2bb3046a59>`__, Flyte has served production model training and data processing for over four years, becoming the de-facto platform for the Pricing, Locations, ETA, Mapping teams, Growth, Autonomous and other teams.
