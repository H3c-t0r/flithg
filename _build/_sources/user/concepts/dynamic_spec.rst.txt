Dynamic Job Spec
================

A dynamic job spec is a subset of the full workflow spec that defines a set of tasks, workflows as well as 
nodes and output bindindgs that control how the job should assemble its outputs.

This spec is currently only supported as an intermediate step in running :ref:`Dynamic Tasks <dynamic-task-type>`.

        repeated Node nodes = 1;

    }

Tasks
-----

Defines one or more :ref:`Tasks <concepts-tasks>` that can then be referenced in the spec.

Subworkflows
------------

Defines zero or more :ref:`Workflows <concepts-workflows>` that can then be referenced in the spec.

Nodes
-----

Defines one or more :ref:`Nodes <concepts-nodes>` that can run in parallel to produce the final outputs of the spec.

Outputs
-------

Defines one or more binding that instructs engine on how to assemble the final outputs.
