Typical flow using flyte-cli
-----------------------------
  * When you request an execution of a Workflow using the UI, Flyte CLI or other stateless systems, the system first calls the
    getLaunchPlan endpoint and retrieves a Launch Plan matching the name for a version. The Launch Plan definition includes the definitions of all the input variables declared for the Workflow.
  * The user-side component then ensures that all required inputs are supplied and requests the FlyteAdmin service for an execution
  * The Flyte Admin service validates the inputs, making sure that they are all specified and, if required, within the declared bounds.
  * Flyte Admin then fetches the previously validated and compiled workflow closure and translates it to an executable format with all of the inputs.
  * This executable Workflow is then launched on Kubernetes with an execution record in the database.
